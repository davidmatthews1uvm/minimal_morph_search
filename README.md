# minimal_morph_search
Searches for robot morphologies using APFO and CPPN genotypes.

# Dependencies
* Install [EvoSoroCore](https://www.github.com/davidmatthews1uvm/EvoSoroCore.git)
  * Install details at EvoSoroCore

# Getting Started
## In softbot_robot.py
* Implement the compute_work method in softbot_robot.py (line 98)
  * This method should assign a fitness for a given robot based on it's morphology.

## In utils.py (optional)
* Set the workspace size for robots (line 21)
* Set the minimum fraction of non-empty voxels for any robot (line 22)
* Set the number of materials you wish to use (line  25)

## In job.py (optional)
* set the population size (line 35)
* set the number of generations (line 36)
* set if you want printing per generation or not (line 38)

# Running your experiments
* `mkdir run`
* `cd run`
* `python ../job.py <seed>`
  * e.g. `python ../jobs.py 0`
